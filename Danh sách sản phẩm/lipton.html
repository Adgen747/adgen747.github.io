    <p>Lipton is the worldâ€™s leading tea brand and is sold in more than 150 countries, providing products ranging from tea bags to bottled iced tea. In 1880, Glasgow-born entrepreneur and innovator Sir Thomas Lipton saw the opportunity to make tea universally accessible with guaranteed quality at affordable prices. He began by purchasing tea estates in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and arranged packaging and shipping at low costs. In 1893, he established Thomas J Lipton Co., a tea-packing company with its HQ and factory in Hoboken, New Jersey, US.</p>
